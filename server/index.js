//When building a server with Node.js and Express.js, you need to do the following:
//1. Require Express - const express = require('express');
//2. Initialize an instance of express and save it to a variable - const app = express();
//3. Use middleware to invoke your JSON parser - app.use(express.json());
//4. Use app.listen to define where the server should listen for requests - 
//   app.listen(4444, () => console.log(`Server running on 4444`))

const express = require('express');
//When using controllers, they need to be required to the main server file so that you can 
//access their handler functions.
const grassCtrl = require('./controllers/grassCtrl');
const pokeCtrl = require('./controllers/pokemonCtrl');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

//grassCtrl endpoints
app.get('/api/wild-pokemon', grassCtrl.getWildPokemon);

//pokeCtrl endpoints
app.get('/api/caught-pokemon', pokeCtrl.getCaughtPokemon);
app.post('/api/caught-pokemon', pokeCtrl.catchPokemon);
app.put('/api/caught-pokemon/:id', pokeCtrl.editName);
app.delete('/api/caught-pokemon/:id', pokeCtrl.releasePokemon);

app.listen(4444, () => console.log('Server is running on 4444'));

//Class Components are components capable of holding state and using lifecycle methods
//To build one, follow these steps:
//1. import React, {Component} from 'react
//2. Create a class that extends Component
//3. Return a JSX display using render
//4. Export the component

//To view how to build a functional component, visit ./Components/Header.js
